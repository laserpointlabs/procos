# Seamless Memory Management for procos

## Core Memory Behaviors

I will **automatically** store memories during these situations:

### 🔄 **Automatic Memory Triggers**
- **Architecture decisions** or design pattern choices
- **Problem solutions** that took multiple attempts
- **System configuration** changes or discoveries
- **Integration patterns** between procos services
- **Performance optimizations** or best practices
- **Bug fixes** with root cause analysis
- **New feature implementations** with design rationale
- **Database schema** or data model changes
- **Infrastructure** setup or deployment insights

### 🧠 **Memory Categories**

**Technical Entities:**
- System components and their relationships
- API endpoints and integration patterns
- Database schemas and data flows
- Infrastructure configuration
- Development tools and workflows

**Decision Entities:**
- Architecture choices with reasoning
- Technology selections and trade-offs
- Design patterns and their applications
- Performance optimization strategies

**Learning Entities:**
- Problem-solution pairs
- Debugging insights and techniques
- Best practices discovered
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## Implementation Pattern

### Before Major Actions:
1. **Search existing memory** for relevant context
2. **Apply learned patterns** from previous work
3. **Proceed with informed decisions**

### After Significant Work:
1. **Identify key learnings** from the session
2. **Store important entities** and relationships
3. **Update existing memories** with new insights
4. **Cross-reference** related information

### Memory Storage Format:
```javascript
// Automatically store entities like:
{
  name: "DADMS_Service_Integration_Pattern",
  type: "architecture_pattern", 
  observations: [
    "Services communicate via REST APIs with standardized error handling",
    "Event-driven updates use Redis pub/sub for real-time notifications",
    "Database transactions maintain consistency across service boundaries"
  ]
}
```

## Proactive Memory Management

I will **seamlessly** manage memory by:

- **Detecting** when significant project information emerges
- **Automatically storing** important technical decisions
- **Updating** existing memories with new insights
- **Cross-referencing** related concepts and patterns
- **Retrieving** relevant context before making recommendations

This ensures our DADMS development sessions build upon previous knowledge and maintain continuity across conversations.

## Example Workflow

```
User: "Let's implement user authentication"

My Process:
1. 🔍 Search memory for "authentication", "user_management", "security"
2. 📋 Apply existing patterns (JWT, session management, etc.)
3. 💻 Implement the solution
4. 💾 Store: authentication decisions, security patterns, integration points
5. 🔗 Link: to user service, database schemas, API patterns
```

This creates a **learning system** where each development session improves our collective knowledge base.
