# DADMS Memory Query & Management

## When to Use This Rule
- User asks "What did we decide about...?"
- User wants to recall previous architectural choices
- User needs context about existing implementations
- User asks about past problems and solutions
- User wants to understand system relationships

## Memory Search Capabilities

### Quick Searches
- Search by topic: authentication, architecture, infrastructure
- Search by component: services, database, API patterns
- Search by type: decisions, problems, solutions, configurations

### Relationship Queries
- Find related components and dependencies
- Trace decision histories and rationales
- Identify similar patterns used elsewhere

## Example Queries
```
"What authentication patterns have we used?"
"How did we solve the database connection issue?"
"What are our service port allocations?"
"Show me the infrastructure setup decisions"
```

## Memory Tools Available
- Search memories by keywords
- Find entities by name
- Read full graph relationships
- Retrieve historical context
- Cross-reference related decisions

This rule enables intelligent memory retrieval without manual tool selection.
