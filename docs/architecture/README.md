# ProcOS - Process-Oriented Operating System

## 🌟 Overview

**ProcOS** represents the evolution of DADMS into a revolutionary **Process-Oriented Operating System** that treats **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)** as the fundamental "kernel language" for all system operations. Unlike traditional operating systems that rely on imperative code, ProcOS defines system behavior entirely through visual process definitions.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy: "Processes Drive Everything"

In ProcOS, **every system operation is a process**:
- ⚙️ **System Boot**: BPMN process orchestrates startup sequence
- 📁 **File Operations**: Process-defined file management workflows  
- 🔄 **Service Communication**: BPMN orchestrates all inter-service messaging
- ❌ **Error Handling**: Recovery processes defined in visual workflows
- 👤 **User Interactions**: Process-driven user experience flows

This creates an unprecedented level of **flexibility** and **runtime reconfigurability** while maintaining complete **auditability** of all system operations.
