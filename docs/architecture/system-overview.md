# ProcOS System Architecture Overview

## üéØ System Vision

ProcOS (Process-Oriented Operating System) is a BPMN-driven microkernel architecture where BPMN processes serve as the "kernel language" and Camunda acts as the execution engine. This creates a process-centric operating environment where complex workflows orchestrate AI workers, data processing, and system operations.

## üß† Core Principles

### **1. BPMN as Kernel Language**
- **All operations** defined as BPMN processes
- **Visual workflow** representation of system behavior
- **Standard notation** enables collaboration and understanding
- **Version control** for process definitions

### **2. External Task Pattern**
- **Decoupled workers** poll for tasks from Camunda
- **Polyglot execution** - workers in any language
- **Horizontal scaling** - multiple workers per task type
- **Fault tolerance** - built-in retry and error handling

### **3. Process-Centric Data Storage**
- **Camunda as primary data store** using process variables
- **PostgreSQL persistence** for all process execution data
- **Automatic versioning** and audit trails
- **Context preservation** across process instances

    participant K as ProcOS Kernel
    participant C as Camunda Engine
    participant P as PostgreSQL
    participant W as AI Worker
    
    K->>P: Check database connection
    K->>C: Start Camunda engine
    C->>P: Create/update schema
    C->>C: Deploy BPMN processes
    K->>W: Start external workers
    W->>C: Subscribe to topics
    
    Note over K,W: System ready for process execution
```

### **2. Process Instance Execution**
```mermaid

    participant W as Worker
    participant P as PostgreSQL
    participant AI as AI Service
    
    U->>C: Start process instance
    C->>P: Store process state
    C->>W: External task created
    W->>C: Fetch and lock task
    W->>AI: Execute AI operation
    AI->>W: Return results
    W->>C: Complete task with variables
    C->>P: Update process state
    C->>U: Process completed

## üéØ Summary

ProcOS represents a paradigm shift from traditional application architectures to a process-centric operating environment. By using BPMN as the kernel language and Camunda as the execution engine, we create a system that is:

- **Visually comprehensible** through standard BPMN notation
- **Technically robust** with enterprise-grade persistence and monitoring
- **Infinitely extensible** through the external worker pattern
- **AI-ready** with built-in support for multiple AI providers

The PostgreSQL foundation ensures that all process execution data, AI context, and operational history is preserved, making ProcOS suitable for production workloads that require data persistence, audit trails, and reliable process execution.
