## Procos — Start Here

### The one-liner
Procos is a small, composable set of services that work together like a virtual operating system for your software. Instead of hard-coding behavior into every app or team, you grow shared capabilities as services that any app can use.

### What it is
- **Composable services**: Focused building blocks (e.g., identity/policy, process orchestration, messaging, state, observability) that can be run and evolved independently.
- **A virtual OS for your domain**: Apps call common capabilities via clear APIs, rather than re-implementing them.
- **Grow-as-you-go**: Start small with just what you need; add new capabilities without rewrites.

### Why it matters
- **Faster delivery**: Teams ship features, not boilerplate.
- **Consistency and control**: Shared policies and behaviors are centrally defined and reused.
- **Lower risk and cost**: Fewer one-off implementations; fewer reworks.
- **Adaptable by design**: Capabilities evolve as services, not as tangled code in many apps.

### How it works (at a glance)
1. **Core services provide capabilities**: Identity/policy, messaging/events, process orchestration, storage/state, and telemetry.
2. **Apps compose, don’t rebuild**: Apps call these services over stable contracts.
3. **Capabilities are additive**: New services can be introduced without changing existing app code paths.
4. **Policies are first-class**: Guardrails and governance ship as services, not slide decks.

### A simple example
Start with identity/policy and messaging. Later add scheduling and workflow. Existing apps opt-in by calling the new services—no rewrites, no forks of shared libraries.

### What Procos is not
- Not a framework rewrite or lock-in.
- Not a replacement for your cloud or vendor tools.
- Not a silver bullet—it's a way to standardize the boring parts so teams can focus on value.

### Where we are today
- MVP focus: define the smallest useful set of services and contracts.
- Documentation-first: we will expand this section with architecture, glossary, and usage patterns.

### 30-second pitch
Procos lets us grow a simple, shared “virtual OS” for our organization—capabilities like identity, policy, messaging, and workflows—so teams build on reliable services, ship faster, and keep control as we scale.
