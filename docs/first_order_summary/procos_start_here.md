## Procos — Start Here (For Managers)

### In plain words
Procos helps a subject-matter expert (SME) grow a simple “virtual operating system” around their know‑how. Think of it like growing an expert system step by step, not buying a big platform.

### What the tool does
- Guides an SME (with a digital assistant) to capture how work should be done
- Runs that work the same way every time
- Records what happened and what was learned
- Lets you add new steps or rules without a rebuild

### The digital assistant (DAS)
- Watches all actions
- Stores discussions, tasks, tests, and results as knowledge
- Surfaces this knowledge later when you design, run, or review work

### How we grow the system
We use only BPMN processes to describe work. This keeps changes clear and testable.

There are only three base parts:
1. Micro‑kernel: a tiny core that keeps the system stable
2. Process Definition Orchestrators (PDO): run BPMN processes end‑to‑end
3. Task Definition Executors (TDE): do the concrete work inside each step

With just these, an SME can start small (an MVP), test it, then ship it. Users can keep growing the system by adding new processes and tasks over time.

### Why this matters
- Shorter time to first value: ship an MVP quickly
- Lower risk: changes are small, visible, and testable
- Knowledge stays: what people discuss and learn is saved and reused
- Less rework: add or change steps without rewriting apps

### What you get on day one
- A minimal system that runs a few key processes
- The DAS capturing context and results
- A clear path to add more processes and tasks

### What this is not
- Not a big platform rewrite
- Not a lock‑in framework
- Not a black box: processes are plain BPMN;
  tasks are simple, testable units

### The pitch
Procos lets your teams start small, run real work, learn fast, and grow safely—using simple BPMN processes, a tiny core, and a built‑in assistant that turns actions into lasting knowledge.
