# ProcOS Logs Directory

This directory contains all log files generated by ProcOS services, organized by category.

## Directory Structure

```

## Log Categories

### Kernel Logs (`kernel/`)
- `kernel.log` - Main microkernel operations
- Process instance logs
- System bootstrapping and health monitoring

### Worker Logs (`workers/`)
- `ai_worker.log` - AI-powered task processing
- `generic_worker.log` - General task processing
- External task polling and execution

### Service Logs (`services/`)
- `context_manager.log` - Context Manager service
- `deploy_processes.log` - Process deployment operations
- Other microservice logs

### Test Logs (`tests/`)
- Test execution results
- Integration test outputs
- Performance test metrics

## Log Configuration

Logging is configured via environment variables:
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Console log level (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR)
- `FILE_LOG_LEVEL`: File log level (typically DEBUG for comprehensive logs)

## Log Rotation

Log files grow as services run. Consider implementing log rotation in production:
- Use logrotate on Linux systems
- Or implement programmatic rotation in the logging configuration
- Archive old logs periodically

## Viewing Logs

```bash
# View live logs from all services
tail -f logs/**/*.log

# View specific service logs
tail -f logs/workers/ai_worker.log

# Search across all logs
grep -r "ERROR" logs/

# View logs by date
grep "2024-01-15" logs/**/*.log
```

## Cleanup

Log files are automatically ignored by git but preserved locally for debugging.
To clean up old logs:

```bash
# Remove all logs (be careful!)
rm -rf logs/**/*.log

# Remove logs older than 7 days
find logs/ -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -delete
```
